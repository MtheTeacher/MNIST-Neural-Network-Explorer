# MNIST Data Source Guidelines (Obsolete)

This file is no longer necessary.

The application has been updated to exclusively use the recommended, Google-hosted data source for the MNIST dataset, which has proven to be highly reliable. Previous data loading issues were determined to be related to client-side data parsing and TensorFlow.js type incompatibilities, not the data source itself.

Therefore, this document detailing alternative sources and fallbacks is now obsolete and can be disregarded or deleted.
